        <h5>Each player must pick one player piece to use for the rest of the game. This will represent where you are on
          the board.
          <br>
          <br>
          Choose a player to start, the turns will continue in a clockwise rotation. The first player will roll the dice
          and advance to the square that corresponds to your roll. You will either land on a Questions or Action square.
          You must read aloud and follow the instructions from ced card.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you are able to complete the task, you may keep your player piece on that square. If you fail to do so, you
          must remain where your Player piece was at the start of your turn.
          <br>
          <br>
          To earn points, you must answer the most questions. Each question card has a different levels.The darker the
          yellow, the harder the questions. These will be worth the most points in reward tokens. Hopefully this will
          encourage you to share and listen to others in order to win the game. As the game goes on you will continue to
          collect your reward tokens.
          <br>
          <br>
          The player to complete the hike with the most reward tokens wins!

              <br>You must then proceed to do whatever the card is written involving your peers.<br>

              be easy to say.<br>

            <br>If you land on an Question square, you must pick up a yellow question card from the center pile.
            <br>
            <br>Depending on the shade of yellow you land on, you must answer the corresponding question from the
            card.
            <br>
            <br> Each player has the right to pass on any question if they feel uncomfortable answering, but remember
            the more vulnerable you are, the stronger you become !<br>
            <br>These questions where designed to help you open up to others, while feeling rewarded by doing so.<br>
            <br>Some questions are even written by students and staff here in M building !
