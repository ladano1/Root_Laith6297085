        For the Capy Skill Level I would consider myself Between levels 6 and 8 when it comes to time management.

      <p>
   I am aiming to reach level 10 where I can keep track of my assingments and their due dates and always ask peers and teachers their opinion about my assignments if they look good or they don't
